# vCLO: Virtual Chief Legal Officer

**AI legal team with 9 specialist virtual lawyers and 168 legal skills, built to handle real legal work 24×7.**

Imagine having a team of 9 specialist lawyers.
Available 24 × 7 × 365.
For free.

That’s the idea behind vCLO: an open-source AI legal team built to handle real legal work.

Contracts. Corporate. Litigation. Compliance. Employment. IP. Investigations. Legal research. And more.

Give vCLO a legal matter. It brings in the relevant specialists, works through the documents and issues, checks the work, and brings everything together into one coherent output.

Under the hood are 160+ Legal AI Skills covering everyday legal work as well as complex matters such as M&A due diligence, contract negotiations, litigation preparation and internal investigations.

vCLO helps lawyers, in-house teams, startups and businesses handle legal work using specialist virtual lawyers, coordinated workflows, official company registries and authorised documents and services.

It can help with:

- contract review, drafting and redlining;
- M&A legal due diligence;
- court litigation, arbitration, mediation and legal research;
- corporate, secretarial and employment work;
- privacy and regulatory compliance;
- IP review, investigations and evidence handling.

Install it once and describe the legal task in plain language. For a simple task, vCLO uses the relevant legal skill. For a complex matter, it coordinates the appropriate specialists and produces one consolidated work product.

## Install vCLO

Tell Codex: 

`Install vCLO from https://github.com/rohasnagpal/legal-ai-skills. Register the repository as a plugin source and install vclo-by-rohas@rohas-legal.`

Approve the installation, start a new task, and say 

`Hello vCLO`.

**Who this is for:** Practising lawyers, in-house counsel, startups, businesses and law students.

**Jurisdiction:** Most skills are jurisdiction-neutral and work anywhere. Skills that turn on Indian statutes are marked **(India)**. Every skill is written to confirm the governing jurisdiction before relying on a specific rule.

## How vCLO works

```text
vCLO
├── 1 Virtual Chief Legal Officer
├── 9 Specialist Virtual Lawyers
├── 168 Specialist Legal Skills
└── 6 Coordinated Legal Workflows
```

A request for M&A legal due diligence, for example, can be divided among corporate, contracts, employment, IP, litigation and compliance specialists, then consolidated into one issue register and report.

The specialist virtual lawyers cover contracts, corporate, court litigation, dispute resolution, compliance, employment, intellectual property, investigations and legal research.

## Documents and connected services

vCLO can work with documents you provide and, where you authorise access in Codex, services such as Google Drive and Docs, Gmail, Google Calendar, SharePoint, OneDrive, Outlook, GitHub and legal-research tools. Its legal-research guidance includes maintained official-source-first guides for India, the United States and the United Kingdom. If a source is unavailable, vCLO will identify what remains to be checked instead of presenting it as verified.

## Company registries

vCLO includes read-only access to three official sources:

- **SEC EDGAR** — US SEC filer profiles and filings; no account required.
- **GLEIF** — global Legal Entity Identifier records; no account required.
- **UK Companies House** — UK company profiles, filings, officers, persons with significant control and charges. Companies House requires a free access key, stored in macOS Keychain (or an environment variable on other platforms); see the [MCP README](plugins/vclo-by-rohas/mcp/README.md).

Ask vCLO to “search the available official registries for *company name* in *jurisdiction*.” Registry coverage is not universal, and an empty result is not proof that an entity does not exist or is in good standing.

# 2. Before you use these

These skills are drafting and analysis aids. They do not give legal advice and
they are not a substitute for professional judgment.

AI models can be wrong about the law, and can produce citations, section
numbers and quotations that look correct and are not. Every skill here is
written to mark what it has verified and what it has not: but that marking is
itself generated text. **Check every output against primary sources before
relying on it.**

# 3. Contributing

Corrections, bug reports and suggestions are welcome: please open an issue.

New skills by discussion first. Open an issue describing the skill before
writing it, so we can agree the scope and check it does not overlap something
already in the library. Skills are reviewed for legal substance before merging,
not just for structure.

Contributions are accepted under the MIT licence.
