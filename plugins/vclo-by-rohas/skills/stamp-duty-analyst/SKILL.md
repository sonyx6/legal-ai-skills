description: Calculates stamp duty and registration cost for a property transaction using only the rates the user actually supplies, showing the arithmetic and the valuation base used, and flagging every current rate, circle-rate value, or exemption eligibility as needing verification rather than asserted from memory. Use this whenever a user needs stamp duty or registration cost worked out — including phrasings like "calculate stamp duty on this sale deed", "what's the registration fee on this property transfer", "does this qualify for a stamp duty concession", or "work out the total stamp duty and registration cost using these rates". India-specific — stamp duty is a state subject with rates that vary by state and change over time. A quantification tool, not a legal validity assessment; pair with sale-deed-drafter for the instrument itself.

# Stamp Duty Analyst

## Jurisdiction gate

This skill applies Indian law and procedure only. Before substantive analysis or drafting, confirm that the matter is governed by Indian law and identify the relevant State, court, tribunal or authority where material.

If the matter is governed by another jurisdiction, or the governing jurisdiction is unclear, do not apply Indian rules. State the scope mismatch and ask for the governing jurisdiction or route the request to an appropriate jurisdiction-neutral skill.


## What this does

Calculates the stamp duty and registration cost for a property transaction, using only the rates the user actually supplies or that are sourced this session. It shows the arithmetic in full, states which valuation base was used and why, and flags every rate, circle-rate value, and exemption eligibility that has not been confirmed as something requiring verification — never asserting a current figure from memory, since stamp duty is set state by state in India and changes periodically.

## Before you start

**The transaction details.** Property value or consideration, the instrument type (sale, gift, lease, mortgage — stamp duty treatment differs by instrument type), and the state where the property is located, since stamp duty is a state subject. Blocking.

**The applicable stamp duty rate.** Must be supplied by the user or sourced this session. Do not assert a current rate from memory — rates vary by state, change over time, and in some states carry category-based concessions that affect the applicable figure.

Not blocking, ask once and proceed on what is confirmed: **whether any exemption or concession might apply** — a category-based rebate, a first-time buyer concession. Ask, and flag eligibility as needing verification rather than assumed.

## Method

**1. Classify the instrument type precisely** — sale deed, gift deed, lease deed, mortgage, power of attorney — since stamp duty treatment and the applicable rate differ by instrument type.

**2. Confirm the property's location precisely**, including any municipal classification that affects the rate, since this determines which rate schedule applies.

**3. Determine the valuation base.** Stamp duty is typically calculated on the higher of the actual consideration or the government-notified guidance or circle-rate value. Flag that the current circle-rate value needs to be checked or supplied; do not assume actual consideration is always the correct base.

**4. Calculate stamp duty using only the rate actually supplied**, applied to the correct valuation base, showing the arithmetic precisely so it can be checked.

**5. Calculate the registration fee separately, if a distinct rate applies.** Registration fees are often calculated differently from stamp duty itself — a different percentage, sometimes capped — and should use only supplied rates, not an assumed relationship to the stamp duty figure.

**6. Flag any potential exemption or concession** — a category-based rebate, a specific buyer concession — as needing verification of current eligibility criteria and rate. Do not assume eligibility.

**7. Note any additional applicable charge — a surcharge, a cess — only if a rate for it has actually been supplied.**

**8. Show the total computation clearly**, with every rate and figure traced to its source: supplied by the user, sourced this session, or flagged as needing verification.

## Output

**1. Header.** Property, transaction type, state, date.

**2. Valuation base.** Consideration versus circle-rate value, which is being used and why, flagged if the circle-rate figure needs confirmation.

**3. Stamp duty calculation.** Shown with the rate used and its source.

**4. Registration fee calculation.** Shown similarly, with its own source noted.

**5. Exemptions and concessions.** Flagged for verification, not assumed to apply.

**6. Total.** Summed clearly, every component traceable.

**7. Points requiring verification.** Any current applicable rate not supplied, the circle-rate value, and exemption eligibility.

## Do not

Do not assert a current stamp duty or registration fee rate from memory. Use only supplied or sourced rates.

Do not assume actual consideration is the valuation base without checking it against the circle or guidance rate.

Do not assume an exemption or concession applies without its eligibility being verified.

Do not assess the legal validity of the transaction. This skill quantifies stamp duty and registration cost only.
