name: encumbrance-analyst
description: Reads an encumbrance certificate for a property, extracting every entry chronologically, flagging charges that appear still subsisting, checking the chain of title implied by the transaction entries for gaps or breaks, and stating plainly what the certificate cannot show — a "nil encumbrance" period is not proof of clean title. Use this whenever a user has an encumbrance certificate to review — including phrasings like "check this encumbrance certificate for charges", "does this EC show a clean title", "is this mortgage still subsisting on the property", or "read this EC and flag anything concerning". India-specific. Fires for any encumbrance certificate review, as one input to a fuller title investigation — pair with title-diligence-analyst for the complete picture.

# Encumbrance Analyst

## Jurisdiction gate

This skill applies Indian law and procedure only. Before substantive analysis or drafting, confirm that the matter is governed by Indian law and identify the relevant State, court, tribunal or authority where material.

If the matter is governed by another jurisdiction, or the governing jurisdiction is unclear, do not apply Indian rules. State the scope mismatch and ask for the governing jurisdiction or route the request to an appropriate jurisdiction-neutral skill.


## What this does

Reads an encumbrance certificate — the Indian land record document showing registered transactions and charges against a property over a stated period — and extracts every entry, flags any charge that appears still subsisting, checks the chain of title the transaction entries imply for internal consistency, and states plainly what the certificate cannot show. An encumbrance certificate is only as complete as the underlying registration record; it does not catch off-register risk, and treating a clean-looking certificate as proof of clean title is the single most common way this document gets over-relied on.

## Before you start

**The encumbrance certificate itself.** Blocking — there is nothing to analyse without the actual document or its text.

**The period the certificate needs to cover for this transaction, and whether the supplied certificate actually covers it.** Ask; do not assume a standard search period is sufficient. What period is actually needed depends on the applicable due diligence standard for this transaction, which should be confirmed rather than assumed.

Not blocking, ask once and proceed on what is available: **whether other title documents — sale deeds, mutation records — are available to cross-check against the certificate's entries.** Cross-checking strengthens the analysis but is not required to extract and flag what the certificate itself shows.

## Method

**1. Read the whole certificate once, extracting every entry chronologically** — transaction type, parties, date, and any charge or encumbrance noted.

**2. Check the period covered against what is actually needed for this transaction.** Flag it if the certificate does not cover a sufficient period; do not assert what period is "sufficient" as a universal rule — note that it depends on the applicable due diligence standard, and that standard should be confirmed, not assumed.

**3. Identify every charge or encumbrance that appears still subsisting** — an unreleased mortgage, a lien, a court attachment, a pending notice — and flag each as needing verification of its current status. Do not assume a charge has been released simply because no later release entry appears, and do not assume it has not been released simply because none is shown — flag it either way; certificates can be incomplete or delayed in reflecting a release.

**4. Treat "nil" or gap periods carefully.** A nil-encumbrance entry for a period does not guarantee no risk existed, since the certificate is only as complete as the underlying registration record. State this limitation plainly: unregistered agreements, litigation not yet reflected in the record, and unregistered leases are examples of risk an encumbrance certificate does not catch at all.

**5. Cross-check the chain of title implied by the certificate's transaction entries for internal consistency.** Does each transfer flow from the party who held the property according to the prior entry, or is there a break or an unexplained gap in the sequence.

**6. Flag any entry that is ambiguous, illegible in the original, or uses local terminology or abbreviations needing confirmation of meaning.** Do not guess at what an ambiguous entry means.

**7. Note where an entry points to a risk needing further diligence outside the certificate itself** — a mortgage entry, for instance, means checking with the lender or the sub-registrar for a no-dues certificate or release deed, not relying on the certificate's own silence about what happened afterward.

**8. State the overall risk assessment clearly** — clean chain, gaps present, active encumbrance found, or needs further verification — rather than leaving the reader to infer a conclusion from the entry list alone.

## Output

**1. Header.** Property, the period the certificate covers, issuing authority, date of analysis.

**2. Chronological entries.** As they appear, in a table.

**3. Subsisting charges and encumbrances.** Flagged for current-status verification.

**4. Chain-of-title consistency check.** Any break or gap noted specifically.

**5. Coverage limitations.** What the certificate does not and cannot show, stated plainly as its own section, not folded into a caveat at the end.

**6. Ambiguous entries.** Flagged, not guessed at.

**7. Overall risk assessment.**

**8. Points requiring verification.** Current status of any subsisting charge, sufficiency of the period covered, and the meaning of any ambiguous entry.

## Do not

Do not treat a nil-encumbrance period as proof of clean title. State the certificate's inherent limitations plainly.

Do not assume a charge has been released, or that it has not been released, without flagging its current status for verification either way.

Do not guess at the meaning of an ambiguous or illegible entry.

Do not assert what period of search is "sufficient" as a universal rule. Flag it as depending on the applicable due diligence standard.

Do not treat the certificate as a complete title investigation on its own. It is one input; note that a fuller review, such as title-diligence-analyst, is the complementary step for the complete picture.
