name: contract-summariser
description: Produces a short, factual, neutral summary of what a contract actually does — the parties, what is being exchanged, the key commercial terms, and the handful of provisions worth knowing before reading the whole document. Use this when a user wants the gist rather than a review — including phrasings like "what does this contract actually say", "summarise this NDA for me", "give me the two-minute version of this agreement", "what are we actually signing up to", "plain-English rundown of this lease", or "brief the team on what this MSA covers". Neutral by default — it does not take a side or grade risk; hand off to contract-reviewer for that, or to obligations-extractor for a complete deadline ledger. Fires for any commercial agreement type.

# Contract Summariser

## What this does

Reads a contract and reports, in plain language, what it actually does: who the parties are, what each gives and gets, the commercial terms, and the small number of provisions a reader needs to know about before going further. It is descriptive, not evaluative — it does not grade a clause as favourable or risky, does not propose wording, and does not build a complete obligations ledger. It restates what the document says; it adds no legal opinion and no judgment about whether the deal is a good one.

## Before you start

Unlike a review, this skill does not need to know which side the user acts for — it does not take a position, so there is nothing blocking here beyond the document itself.

Not blocking, ask once and proceed on a reasonable default without it: **who the summary is for.** A business stakeholder who needs the shape of the deal, a client deciding whether to sign, or a colleague picking up a file they have not seen. This shapes register and depth, not content — default to a plain-language summary usable by a non-lawyer reader unless told otherwise.

If a schedule, annexure or incorporated document referred to in the main agreement was not supplied, note plainly that it was not available and that anything it would govern is not reflected in the summary. Do not guess its contents, and do not let its absence stop the summary of what was supplied.

## Method

**1. Classify what you have been given**, in one line — complete executed agreement, complete draft, or excerpt — before summarising anything.

**2. Read the whole document once before writing a word of the summary.** A clause read in isolation routinely misstates what a contract does once you see how it interacts with the rest of the document — the same discipline a full review applies, applied here to get the gist right rather than to grade risk.

**3. Write the deal in one or two plain sentences first.** Parties, subject matter, and what is being exchanged — the version a reader gets if they read nothing else. Get this right before adding any further detail.

**4. Pull the structural facts.** Parties by their exact legal names, effective or commencement date, term and renewal or expiry mechanics, price or consideration, and the core deliverable. These are facts to report accurately, not to round for readability — a plain-language summary is not a license to approximate a number, a date or a defined term.

**5. Identify the handful of provisions a plain reader actually needs flagged** — not a full sweep of the document, a short list of what stands out for a contract of this type: exclusivity, notable restrictions such as non-compete or non-solicit, what triggers termination, whether liability is capped and by how much, anything genuinely unusual. Describe each factually — what it is — without saying whether it is good, bad, or worth negotiating.

**6. Keep the whole thing short.** A routine contract should summarise to roughly half a page. If the request actually needs a full risk grading, a complete obligations ledger, or a clause-by-clause comparison, say that a fuller treatment is available through contract-reviewer, obligations-extractor or clause-comparator, and do not expand this skill's output to cover it.

## Output

**1. Headline.** One or two plain sentences stating what the deal is, before anything else.

**2. Key facts.** A short list or table: Parties | Effective date | Term and renewal | Price or consideration | Governing law. Report figures, dates and defined terms exactly as the document states them.

**3. What each party gives and gets.** Plain sentences, described neutrally rather than from either side's perspective.

**4. Notable provisions.** A short bullet list of what stands out for this contract type — exclusivity, restrictive covenants, liability cap or its absence, unusual termination triggers — stated factually, with a clause reference for each.

**5. Not covered.** Schedules or documents referred to but not supplied, and anything else the summary could not reach as a result.

Keep the total length to roughly half a page for a routine contract. Offer a longer or more detailed summary only if the user asks for one, rather than defaulting to length.

## Evidence and document controls

- Cite exact clause numbers, headings or document locations for every document-derived finding where available; headings never substitute for operative language.
- Distinguish document facts, user-supplied facts, assumptions and legal inferences. State when a conclusion depends on governing law, disputed facts, claims classification or material outside the contract.
- Check relevant definitions, order of precedence, incorporated documents, related provisions and survival language before concluding.
- Name missing schedules, annexures, policies, referenced agreements and unreadable material. Never invent clauses, quotations, authorities, defined terms, dates or commercial facts.
- Warn when scans, OCR, truncation, tracked changes or incomplete extraction may affect accuracy.
- Preserve confidentiality. Do not send contract contents to an external service unless the user expressly requests that connected workflow.


## Do not

Do not grade a clause as favourable, risky, or one-sided, and do not take a position for either party. That is contract-reviewer's job, not this one's.

Do not propose alternative wording or a redline. This skill describes what exists; it does not change it.

Do not build a complete obligations and deadline ledger here. A user who wants that has asked for obligations-extractor.

Do not round or approximate a figure, date, party name or defined term to make the summary read more simply. Plain language means simple sentences, not imprecise facts.

Do not guess the contents of a schedule or annexure that was not supplied. State that it is missing and move on.

Do not let the summary grow into a full review. If the document or the request genuinely needs more, say so and point to the skill built for it rather than expanding this one past its purpose.

Do not name a statute, legal consequence, or enforceability position that the document itself does not state. This is a restatement of the document, not a legal opinion.
