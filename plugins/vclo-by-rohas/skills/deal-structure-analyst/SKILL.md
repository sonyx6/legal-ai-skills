name: deal-structure-analyst
description: Compares realistic alternative structures for a transaction — asset purchase versus share purchase, merger versus acquisition, direct investment versus a holding-company route, debt versus equity, onshore versus offshore vehicle — and their legal, tax-flagged, liability, and control consequences, before any drafting begins. Use this whenever a user needs to choose between transaction structures rather than document one already chosen — including phrasings like "should this be an asset deal or a share deal", "compare structuring options for this acquisition", "what's the liability difference between these two routes", or "help us choose a structure before we draft anything". Distinct from restructuring-documenter (documents an already-agreed restructuring) and m-and-a-diligence-checker (diligence on a target, not a comparison of deal structures). Spans corporate, startup, and finance work. Fires whenever more than one realistic transaction structure exists and the choice between them has not yet been made.

# Deal Structure Analyst

## Purpose

Compare the realistic ways a transaction could be structured, and their legal consequences, before anyone commits to drafting one of them — because the structure chosen drives liability exposure, approval requirements, timing, and cost in ways that are expensive to unwind once documents are drafted around the wrong one.

## Required inputs

Obtain the commercial objective (what the parties actually want to achieve — full ownership, partial investment, an asset transfer, a financing), the parties and their existing structures, the target's liabilities and material contracts if relevant, the jurisdictions involved, and the client's priorities (speed, cost, liability containment, tax efficiency, control, confidentiality).

Ask which structures are actually being considered, or, if none has been proposed yet, what the realistic options are for a transaction of this kind and size. Do not assume a single obvious structure exists without checking.

## Method

1. Identify the realistic structural alternatives for this transaction — typically two or three, not an exhaustive theoretical list. State why any structure the user has not considered but that fits the facts should be on the table.
2. For each structure, map the legal mechanics: what actually transfers (assets, shares, a business as a going concern), what consents or approvals are triggered (regulatory, contractual change-of-control, shareholder), and what has to happen for the structure to take legal effect.
3. Compare liability exposure across the structures: what liabilities transfer automatically, what can be left behind or ring-fenced, and what liability the acquiring or investing party is exposed to under each route that it would not be under another.
4. Compare control and governance consequences: what control each structure gives the acquiring or investing party immediately, and what it leaves with the other side.
5. Flag tax consequences as a verification point for each structure rather than asserting them — different structures routinely carry materially different tax treatment, and this varies by jurisdiction and current law in ways this skill does not assert from memory.
6. Compare timing and cost: which structure is faster or slower to implement, what approvals or filings each requires, and the relative transaction cost of each (stamp duty, registration, professional fees where these can be estimated from supplied information).
7. Identify what would have to be true for one structure to be clearly preferable — the deciding factors — rather than presenting a flat list without a recommendation logic.
8. Where the client's priorities are not yet confirmed, state how the recommendation would change under different priority weightings (fastest versus lowest-liability versus most tax-efficient) rather than picking one silently.

## Output

1. **Header.** Transaction objective, parties, jurisdictions, client's stated priorities if confirmed, date.
2. **Structures compared.** Each structure named and described in one paragraph.
3. **Comparison matrix.** Structure | What transfers | Approvals/consents triggered | Liability exposure | Control consequences | Relative timing | Relative cost | Tax treatment (flagged for verification).
4. **Deciding factors.** What would make one structure clearly preferable, and under what priority weighting.
5. **Recommendation**, only if the client's priorities are confirmed — otherwise a statement of how the recommendation varies by priority.
6. **Points requiring verification.** Tax treatment under current law in each relevant jurisdiction, and any regulatory approval requirement not yet confirmed.
7. **Next step.** Handoff to the relevant drafting or diligence skill once a structure is chosen.

## Guardrails

- Do not assert a specific tax outcome for any structure. Flag tax treatment as a verification point in every case.
- Do not recommend a structure without the client's priorities confirmed, or without showing how the recommendation would change under different priorities.
- Do not present an exhaustive theoretical list of structures where only two or three are realistic for this transaction's size and facts.
- Do not assume liabilities transfer or stay behind by default — this depends on the specific structure and the jurisdiction's law, and should be flagged accordingly where not certain from the structure's basic legal mechanics.
- Do not draft any document. This skill compares structures; drafting belongs to the relevant contract, corporate, or transaction-specific drafting skill once a structure is chosen.
